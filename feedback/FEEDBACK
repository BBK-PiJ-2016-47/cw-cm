Please look at the general comments to see if any apply.

It would have been good to adopt the gradle/maven directory 
structure; please do so going forward.

Did you run the static analysis tools over your code (e.g., 
findbugs, checkstyle, etc.)?

A reasonable set of tests.

Add javadoc even for private fields and methods.

If your code may throw an explicit exception then consider adding
a "throws" clause to the method signature even if the exception
is unchecked.

If you comment out large sections of code remove them from the 
code you submit. After all, you have a source code control system
so you can always roll the code back to an earlier point.

Why were certain of the fields marked as "protected"?

Again, CMimpl includes blocks of commented out code; please don't 
submit code in this form.

Good attempt. Merit.
